		             Amphibians are small vertebrates that need water, or a moist environment, to survive. The species in this group include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. All can breathe and absorb water through their very thin skin. Amphibians also have special skin glands that produce useful proteins.
					 Amphibians are cold-blooded vertebrates that start their life in water before sprouting legs and walking on land. They have no scales, and they are carnivores. During reproduction, they release eggs that are fertilized outside of the body.
					 Amphibians are cold-blooded vertebrates (vertebrates that have backbones) that don't have scales. They live part of their lives in water and part on land. American Bullfrog.
